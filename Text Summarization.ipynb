       "' technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings systems e g machines applying technology by taking an input changing it according to the system s use and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including today s global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted by products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earth s environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neo luddism anarcho primitivism and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts or to allude to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the term s meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bain s definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucault s work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriam webster learner s dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real world problems it is a far reaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanity s knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective field s knowledge and tools state of the art technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety citation needed engineering is the goal oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already existing tools and knowledge this new found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bush s treatise on postwar science policy science the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the late s however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between and ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanity s progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by ka and into other continents such as eurasia human s technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter gatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge of gold copper silver and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around bce meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat dating to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins the ancient sumerians in mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the tigris and euphrates rivers for irrigation according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in present day iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from to bce with most experts putting it closer to bce the oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made more recently the oldest known wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads the ancient sumerians used the potter s wheel and may have invented it a stone pottery wheel found in the city state of ur dates to around bce and even older fragments of wheel thrown pottery have been found in the same area fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources the first two wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in mesopotamia and iran in around bce the oldest known constructed roadways are the stone paved streets of the city state of ur dating to circa bce and timber roads leading through the swamps of glastonbury england dating to around the same time period the first long distance road which came into use around bce spanned miles from the persian gulf to the mediterranean sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained in around bce the minoans on the greek island of crete built a fifty kilometer thirty mile road leading from the palace of gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of knossos on the north side of the island unlike the earlier road the minoan road was completely paved ancient minoan private homes had running water a bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the palace of knossos several minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain the ancient romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system the primary sewer in rome was the cloaca maxima construction began on it in the sixth century bce and it is still in use today the ancient romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances the first roman aqueduct was built in bce the eleventh and final ancient roman aqueduct was built in ce put together the roman aqueducts extended over kilometers but less than seventy kilometers of this was above ground and supported by arches innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as open heart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientific technological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs the physical chemical epoch the life epoch the human brain epoch the technology epoch the artificial intelligence epoch and the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a techno optimist on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno optimists or techno pessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxley s brave new world anthony burgess s a clockwork orange and george orwell s nineteen eighty four in goethe s faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology s impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished tool using societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and world views darin barney has written about technology s impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as an object of political debate a means or medium of discussion and a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues e g francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still can t do a more infamous anti technological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno industrial infrastructure there are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology such as self identified off gridders the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face what s the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higher end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity for people who use both the internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience fatigue and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns continuous studies have shown that increased bmi and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently heavy internet use is also displayed in the school lower grades of those who use it in excessive amounts it has also been noted that the use of mobile phones whilst driving has increased the occurrence of road accidents particularly amongst teen drivers statistically teens reportedly have fourfold the number of road traffic incidents as those who are years or older and a very high percentage of adolescents write and read texts while driving in this context mass media and technology have a negative impact on people on both their mental and physical health thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definition s emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts internet centrism and solutionism internet centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigal s review of morozov s theory to ignore it will lead to unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technology based planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii e g dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economic based planning the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technology s is uncertain in futurist ray kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping gnr revolution of genetics nanotechnology and robotics with robotics being the most important of the three '"
